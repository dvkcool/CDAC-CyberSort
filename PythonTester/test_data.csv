Cyber Attack/ Dependent Crimes,Malware Attack,"The issue actually started when I got this email, which at first glance seemed like spam. I usually ignore such things, but for some reason, I opened it this time. Afterward, my phone started freezing, and it wasn’t normal. I thought it was a technical glitch, but now I’m not so sure. Honestly, it’s such a mess, and I don’t even know where to start. I’ve contacted support, but they keep giving me the runaround. The more I tried to fix it, the more problems came up. My work account was unathorised, and then I got locked out of everything. I don’t think I’ve ever felt this violated before. My privacy is completely shattered, and I can’t do anything to make it stop. Even my laptop isn’t working right anymore. It’s so stange how everything just fell apart after that one email."
